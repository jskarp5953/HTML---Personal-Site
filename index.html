    <p> I was born in Jackson, Minnesota and I was rasied in Bemidji, Minnesota where I lived for 21 years.
        I graduated from Bemidji Highschool in 1993. I then attended Wadena Tech College and graduated in January 1995 with an AAS degree in Electronics Technology.
        After graduating from college I applied for a job with King Video Cable and got a job as a Service Technition in March of 1995
        King Video cable eventually became US West and I have worked for the same company that has had multiple name changes for 28 years.
